We somehow missed a semi-undocumented CrowdStrike EDR disable* technique that was unveiled in 2022.

It requires administrative access. This makes it more difficult to perform in enterprise environments.

Jonas Lyk discovered the CrowdStrike minifilter did not catch NtCreateFile when the FILE_APPEND_DATA access mask was present. It was possible to open a CrowdStrike driver with FILE_APPEND_DATA and append an additional byte to the driver opened.

When rebooting the machine, the driver signature would not match and CrowdStrike would not load.
